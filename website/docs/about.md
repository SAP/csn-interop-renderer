# About

## Motivation

The [Core Schema Notation Interoperability Specification](https://sap.github.io/csn-interop-specification/) (short: CSN Interop) is a powerful and flexible format used to represent the structure and metadata of data and service models in the wider SAP and BTP ecosystem. CSN files are JSON-based and provide a comprehensive way to describe entities, relationships, and other aspects of the model.

Specifications like the CSN Interop are crucial to build consistent and high-quality APIs around Data Products. However, CSN Interop consumers might still miss important facts about the Data Product they want to start integrating with. This is where the CSN Interoperability Renderer can help.

The CSN Interoperability Renderer tool can take as an input a Data Product specified using the CSN Interoperability Specification and render a markdown documentation out of it. This is particularly usefully because the markdown format is supported my multiple browser visualization tools and can be easily integrated on a various documentation sites.

## Project status

The CSN Interoperability Renderer tooling is released under the BETA version and ready for test purpose adoption.
